# International-Debt
An analysis on the international debt in the world today. The data contains the information on the amount of debt(in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. I found answers the answers to questions like:
-What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
-Which country own the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
-What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
